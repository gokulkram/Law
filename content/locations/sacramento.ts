  intro:
    "If someone else’s carelessness injured you in Sacramento County, you may be entitled to compensation for medical care, lost income and pain. Sacramento cases have a few local features worth knowing up front: large parts of the county are unincorporated, so the CHP - not a city police department - often writes the crash report; the city, the county and SacRT each take government claims at a different office; and since April 2026 civil cases are heard in a new courthouse in the Sacramento Railyards. Lawsuits generally must be filed within **two years**, but claims against a public entity are usually due within **six months**.",
