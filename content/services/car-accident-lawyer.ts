  intro:
    "If you were hurt in a car accident in California that was someone else’s fault, you can claim compensation from the at-fault driver - and often from others, such as an employer or a vehicle manufacturer. You generally have **two years** from the date of the crash to file a lawsuit, but the evidence that proves your case starts disappearing within days. Here is what to do, how fault and insurance work in California, and what your claim can include.",

      { title: "Get medical care first", text: "Call 911 if anyone is hurt. Some injuries - concussions, whiplash, internal bleeding - don’t show symptoms for hours or days. Getting checked promptly protects your health and creates a record linking your injuries to the crash." },

      { title: "Be careful with the other driver’s insurer", text: "Notify your own insurance company, but don’t give a recorded statement to the other driver’s insurer or sign anything before you understand your rights. Early settlement offers are often far below what a claim is worth." },

If your damages are $100,000 and you were found 20% at fault, you can still recover $80,000." },

  faqs: [
    { q: "How long do I have to file a car accident claim in California?", a: "Generally two years from the date of the accident to file a lawsuit for injuries. If a government entity may be responsible, a written claim is usually due within six months. Insurance claims should be reported much sooner." },
    { q: "Do I need a lawyer if the insurance company already made an offer?", a: "Not always, but early offers often don’t account for future medical care, lost earning capacity, or pain and suffering. Once you accept and sign a release, you usually can’t reopen the claim. A free consultation can tell you whether an offer is fair." },
    { q: "Can I recover if I was partly at fault?", a: "Yes. California’s pure comparative fault rule lets you recover even if you share some of the blame; your compensation is reduced by your percentage of fault." },
    { q: "What if the driver who hit me has no insurance?", a: "Your own uninsured motorist (UM) coverage may pay for your injuries. Other sources - an employer, a vehicle owner, or a manufacturer - may also be available depending on the facts." },
    { q: "How much is my car accident case worth?", a: "It depends on your medical costs, lost income, the severity and permanence of your injuries, the available insurance, and how clear fault is. No honest lawyer can give an exact number at the start, but we can explain what affects value in your case." },
    { q: "How much does it cost to hire California Law?", a: "Nothing upfront. We work on a contingency fee, so there is no attorney’s fee unless we win. How case costs are handled is explained in writing before we begin." },
