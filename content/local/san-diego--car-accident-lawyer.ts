  intro:
    "If you were hurt in a car accident in San Diego County, the first practical questions are local ones: which agency wrote the collision report and how you get it, whether a public agency such as the City of San Diego, the County or MTS is involved, and where a lawsuit would be filed. California law sets the rules - generally **two years** to sue the at-fault driver and only **six months** to file a claim against a public entity - but San Diego’s police, CHP offices and courts decide the steps. This page walks through them. For the general law on fault, insurance and compensation, see our [California car accident lawyer page](/car-accident-lawyer).",

In East County, the El Cajon Area covers **I-8**, **SR-125**, **SR-52**, **SR-67**, **SR-94** and backcountry routes such as **SR-79** and **SR-188**.

What matters is often traffic-camera or dashcam footage and the exact lane, direction and exit where the crash happened - details worth writing down before you leave the scene." },

    { q: "I was hit by an MTS bus or trolley. What’s different?", a: "MTS is a public agency, so you generally must present a written claim within six months before you can sue. MTS’s claims policy requires claims to go to its Claims Administrator on its form." },
    { q: "Can I sue the City of San Diego for a dangerous road?", a: "Possibly. A public entity can be liable for a dangerous condition of its property if it caused a foreseeable injury and the city created it or had notice in time to fix it.
